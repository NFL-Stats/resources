Team Data:

    May be easier to pull from than sportsdatabase, looks like it covers some of the same areas

http://www.sportsdatabase.com/nfl/query?output=default&sdql=season+%3D+2013+and+team+%3D+Colts&submit=S+D+Q+L+%21
    Includes sports odds, which could prove very useful as a validation measure

    Tables at the bottom - raw team stats
    By year
    
    http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2013/opp.htm
        Defensive team stats - season
    Schedule Tab on this site could have useful info -- number of turnovers/game by each team
    
    http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/clt/2014_roster.htm
        Rosters for each team
    
Coaching Data:

http://coachingroots.com/football/teams/arizona-cardinals/head-coaches
    No wins/losses, doesn't seem to be well structured, not great history
    
http://www.databasefootball.com/coaches/coachpage.htm?coachid=DUNGYTON01
    Would just need table w/ name attached
    Records by season inc. separate playoff count
    Data only up to 2010
    
Draft Data
